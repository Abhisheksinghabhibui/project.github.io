        <h1>HISTORY OF LUCKNOW FOOD:-</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="history-content">
        <p>
            The most important activity in human life is eating. As any community or nation progresses, its diet is the
            most salient guide to its refinement. For this reason, I should like to discuss the attitude of the court of
            Lucknow towards its cuisine and the extent to which the people of Lucknow improved the art of gastronomy.

            At the time of Shuja-ud-Daula, the supervisor of the court kitchens was Hasan Raza Khan, who went by the
            name of Mirza Hasanu and came of a respectable Delhi family. A Shaikhzada, Maulvi Fazal Azim, had come to
            Lucknow from Safipur (Unnao District, U.P.) to study. By a stroke of fortune he had been received into Mirza
            Hasanu's house. The two had grown up together and Mirza Hasanu appointed him assistant supervisor of the
            kitchens. It was Fazal Azim's custom to prepare the trays for dinner, then put his seal on them and take
            them to the Navab's antechamber. He would personally hand them to Bahu Begam's special maidservants and thus
            ensure that nothing detrimental was done to the food. He also kept on good terms with the maidservants.

            Navab Shuja-ud-Daula had his meals inside the Palace with his wife Bahu Begam. The maidservants brought the
            trays to the Begam, uncovered them in her presence and place the food on the dastarkhwan [tablecloth]. Each
            day food for the Nawab and the Begam came from six separate kitchens. Firstly, there was the Navab's own
            main kitchen supervised by Mirza Hasanu. In this two thousand rupees a day were spent on food, so that,
            apart from the wages of cooks and other servants, 60,000 rupees a month were spent on food and delicacies.
            The second was the subsidiary royal kitchen, the supervisor of which was originally Mirza Hasan Ali, but
            later on was Anbar Ali Khan, a eunuch; here three hundred rupees a day were spent on food. The third kitchen
            belonged to Bahu Begam's apartments, supervised by Bahar Ali Khan, also a eunuch. The fourth was the kitchen
            of Navab Begam, Shuja-ud-Daula's mother, the fifth, Mirza Ali Khan's, and the sixth that of Navab Salar
            Jang. These last two were Bahu Begam's brothers.

            All these six kitchens were excellent and every day produced the most sumptuous and delicious food for the
            dinner of the ruler. One day a fly emerged from the Navab's dish which had been prepared in the royal
            kitchen. The Navab was very annoyed and asked, 'Where has this food come from? ' The maidservant thought
            that if she mentioned the royal kitchen, her adopted brother the Maulvi would get into trouble, so she said,
            'Sir, the meal has come from Navab Salar Jang's kitchen.'

            After Shuja-ud-Daula's time Asaf-ud-Daula gave Mirza Hasan Raza Khan the title of Sarfaraz-ud-daula and
            honoured him with the khilat. Hasan Raza then thought that supervising the kitchens was beneath his dignity
            and appointed Maulvi Fazal Azim for the task, who now took the dinner trays to Asaf-ud-Daula's antechamber.
            He then collected some of his relatives to help him, amongst whom were his brother Maulvi Faiq Ali and his
            two cousins Ghulam Azim and Ghulam Makhdum. The four used to take turns to convey the meals to the
            antechamber.

            Following Asaf-ud-Daula's reign, during the short period of Wazir Ali Khan's rule, Tafazur Husain Khan
            became Vazir. He sent these relatives back to Safipur and appointed Ghulam Muhammad, popularly known as Bare
            Mirza, to be supervisor of the kitchens.

            Thus from the time of Shuja-ud-Daula a very high standard of cooking was maintained. The very best cooks
            were enlisted, elaborate efforts were made in the preparation of foods and innovations were introduced.
            Expert cooks from Delhi and other places polished up their skills and invented new delicacies and special
            savours.

            Sarfaraz-ud-Daula Hasan Raza Khan would prepare the most wonderful meals. He himself was extremely fond of
            good food and entertaining and as supervisor of the main royal kitchen he had every opportunity of
            displaying his talents. Scores of nobles became connoisseurs of good food, though Navab Salar Jang's family
            was the most celebrated for its innovations and delicacies.

            Reliable sources tell us that Navab Salar Jang's cook, who prepared food for him alone, received a monthly
            salary of 1,200 rupees, an amount greater than the salary of any cook in the highest courts in the history
            of India. This cook used to prepare the most enormous pulaus, which no one except Salar Jang could digest.
            One day Navab Shuja-ud-Daula said, ' Why have you never offered me any of those pulaus which are cooked for
            you? ' Salar Jang replied, 'Certainly, I will have one sent to you today.' Accordingly he asked his cook to
            prepare a pulau, but of twice the usual amount. His cook replied, 'I am responsible only for your meals and
            I cannot cook for anyone else.' Salar Jang said, 'The Navab has expressed the desire, can't you possibly
            make him a pulau? ' The cook continued, 'I can't cook for anyone else, whoever he may be.' After much
            persuasion on the part of Salar Jang, the cook finally agreed on condition that he himself would take the
            pulau to the Navab, who would eat it in his presence, that he would not allow the Navab to eat more than a
            few mouthfuls, and that Salar Jang would provide the Navab with plenty of cold water. Salar Jang agreed. The
            cook prepared the pulau and Salar Jang himself placed it on the dastar khwan. As soon as he had tasted the
            pulau, Shuja ud Daula was full of praise and began to eat heartily. He had taken only a few mouthfuls,
            however, when Salar Jang tried to stop him. Shuja-ud-Daula looked at him with annoyance and continued
            eating. But after a few more mouthfuls he became exceedingly thirsty and was happy to drink the cold water
            that Salar Jang had brought with him. Finally his thirst was quenched and Salar Jang went home.

            In those days the best food was considered to be that which appeared light and delicate but was in fact
            heavy and not easily digestible. People with old fashioned taste still have a penchant for this sort of food
            but today it is not generally popular.

            A special art was to produce one particular substance in several different guises. When placed on the table
            it looked as if there were score of different kinds of delicacies, but when one tasted them, one found they
            were all the same. For instance, I have heard that a Prince Mirza Asman Qadar, the son of Mirza Khurram
            Bakht of Delhi, who came to Lucknow and became a Shia, was invited to dine by Wajid Ali Shah. Murabba, a
            conserve, was put on the dastar khwan which looked very light, tasty and delicious. When Asman Qadar tasted
            it he became intrigued because it was not a conserve at all but a qaurma, a meat curry, which the chef had
            made to look exactly like a conserve. He felt embarrassed and Wajid Ali Shah was extremely pleased at having
            been able to trick an honoured Delhi connoisseur.

            A few days later, Mirza Asman Qadar invited Wajid Ali Shah to a meal. Wajid Ali Shah anticipated that a trap
            would be laid for him, but this did not save him from being taken in. Asman Qadar's cook, Shaikh Husain Ali,
            had covered the tablecloth with hundreds of delicacies and many varieties of comestibles. There were pulau,
            zarda, qaurma, kababs, biryani, chapatis, chutneys, achars, parathas, shirmals in fact every kind of food.
            However, when tasted they were all found to be made of sugar. The curry was sugar, the rice was sugar, the
            pickles were sugar and the bread was sugar. It is said that even the plates, the tablecloth, the finger
            bowls and cups were made of sugar. Wajid Ali Shah tried everything and became more and more embarrassed.

            I have said that trays of food for Navab Shuja-ud-Daula's dinners came from six different kitchens. This
            practice was not confined to him alone. It continued after his time and the honour was also accorded to some
            chosen nobles and especially to the royal relations.

            My friend Nawab Muhammad Shafi Khan Nishapuri tells me that his grandfather, Navab Agha Ali Hasan Khan, an
            eminent noble, used to send roghni roti, a rich bread, and metha ghi [ghee] , clarified butter, from his
            house to king. This bread was so fine and cooked with such care that it was not thicker than paper. The
            metha ghee was a very special product which had to be prepared with great care.

            In Delhi the most popular food was biryani, but the taste in Lucknow was more for pulau. To the uninitiated
            palate both are much the same, but because of the amount of spices in biryani there is always a strong taste
            of curried rice, whereas pulau can be prepared with such care that this can never happen. It is true that a
            good biryani is better than an indifferent pulau, for the pulau may be tasteless and this is never so in the
            case of a biryani. But in the view of gourmets a biryani is a clumsy and ill-conceived meal in comparison
            with a really good pulau and for that reason the latter was more popular in Lucknow. There are seven
            well-known kinds of pulaus in Lucknow. I can remember the names of only gulzar, the garden, nur, the light,
            koku, the cuckoo, moti, the pearl and chambeli, jasmine; but in fact scores of different pulaus are served.
            Muhammad Ali Shah's son Mirza Azim ush Shah, on the occasion of a wedding, invited the parents of the bride
            and bridegroom to a dinner at which Wajid Ali Shah was also present. For that occasion there were seventy
            varieties of savoury pulaus and sweet rice dishes.

            At the time of Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar, Navab Husain Ali Khan of Salar Jang's family was a great gourmet who had
            scores of different varieties of pulaus prepared for him. These were so light and delicate that no other
            nobleman could compete with him. Even the King envied him and gourmets would call him 'the rice man'.

            During the reign of Nasir - ud - Din Haidar, a cook came to Lucknow who made Khichri using pistachio nuts
            and almonds instead of rice and lentils. He cut the almonds into rice-shapes and the pistachio nuts into the
            shape of lentils so perfectly that when cooked the dish looked exactly like khichri. Once savoured, the
            taste could never be forgotten.

            At the time of Navab Sadat Ali Khah there was an expert cook who made nothing but gulathis, rice puddings.
            This was the splendour of the royal table, the favourite dish of the ruler and such a delicacy that the
            noblemen all longed for it.

            There is a story about a new cook who came before Navab Asaf-ud-Daula. He was asked, 'What do you cook?' He
            answered, 'I only cook lentils.' When he was then asked what wages he required he replied, 'Five hundred
            rupees.' The Navab agreed to employ him but the cook said, 'I will only take on service under certain
            conditions.' When asked what those were, he said, 'When your Excellency wishes to eat my preparation of
            lentils, you must order it the day before and when I tell you it is ready you must eat it right away.' The
            Navab agreed to these conditions and some months later ordered the cook to prepare his lentils. The cook did
            so and when it was ready informed the Navab who said, 'All right, put it on dastar khwan, I am coming in a
            minute.' The dastar khwan was laid but the Navab became engaged in conversation. The cook reminded him again
            but the Nawab tarried. After a third reminder, when the Navab still did not appear, the cook took the pot of
            lentils, emptied it on the roots of a withered tree and departed. The Navab regretted this and instituted a
            search but no trace of the cook was found. Some days later it was seen that the tree under which the lentils
            had been thrown was now blossoming. There is no doubt that this incident has been exaggerated. Still, one
            can judge from it the esteem accorded to cooks at the court and realize with what liberality an expert chef
            was treated.

            Seeing the interest that the wealthy took in matters of food, cooks tried various innovations. One invented
            a pulau which resembled an anar dana [pomegranate seed] in which half of each grain of rice was fiery red
            like a ruby and the other half was white and sparkled like a crystal. When the pulau was put on the table it
            looked as if the dish had been filled with coloured jewels. Another cook produce a nau ratan
            [nine-precious-gem] pulau, in which the rice was coloured to reproduce the nine well-known gems and the
            colours were so pure and so polished that they were a delight to the eyes. Many more delicacies of this
            nature were created which became known to different houses and kitchens.

            Of the noblemen interested in food, one was Navab Mirza Khan Nishapuri, who was reputed to have a vasiqa of
            14,000 rupees a month. He showed such talent in producing delicious food and enlisting the services of
            expert chefs that his dastar khwan became famed throughout the city. Another was Mirza Haidar, also of
            Nishapur. He was such an honoured and respected nobleman that the Nishapuri community in Lucknow
            acknowledged him as their leader. It was his practice whenever he accepted an invitation to take with him
            all the items necessary for the preparation of betel leaf and a hundred or more huqqas [hookahs], as well as
            the necessary equipment for cooling drinking water. This was a great help to people of moderate means, who
            would make sure to invite him. In this way all arrangements for huqqas, betel leaf and drinking water would
            be his responsibility and these arrangements were always perfect.

            Three classes of people were employed in preparing food. First there were the scullions who cleaned enormous
            pots and dishes and worked under the cook. Second was bavarchi, the cook, who prepared the meals in large
            quantities. Third was rakabdar, the chef, who was the most expert and usually cooked in samall pots for a
            few people only. He considered it beneath his dignity to produce food in large quantities. Cooks, too, like
            to prepared in small quantities, but chefs never do otherwise because in addition to cooking to cooking,
            they are occupied with the presentation and serving of the food. They adorn the dishes with dried fruits cut
            into the shape of flowers, edible silver foils and other embellishments. They prepare light, delicious
            conserves and pickles and exhibit their skill in the gastronomic art in subtle ways.

            Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar was fond of parathas. His chef used to cook six parathas a day and put five seers
            [approximately ten pounds] of ghee into each, that is to say, he used thirty seers of ghee a day. One day
            the Vazir Motamad-ud-Daula Agha Mir sent for him and asked, 'What do you do with thirty seers of ghee a day?
            ' He said, 'Sir, I cook parathas.' The Vazir asked him to cook a paratha so that he could witness this. The
            chef did so and put in all the ghee it would hold and threw the rest away. Motamad-ud-Daula said with
            astonishment, 'You have not used all the ghee.' The chef said, 'What is left over is not worth keeping for
            another meal.' The Vazir could not understand the answer and said; 'Only five seers of ghee a day will be
            given to you, one seer for each paratha.' The chef said, 'Very well, I will cook with that much ghee.' He
            was so angry at the Vazir's interference that he started to cook very indifferent parathas for the King's
            table. After a few days the King remarked, 'What is wrong with these parathas? ' The chef said, 'Your
            Majesty, I cook the parathas as Navab Motamad-ud-Daula Bahadur has ordered.' The King asked for details and
            was given a full account. He immediately sent for the Vazir who said, 'Your Majesty, these people rob you
            right and left.' On this the King became angry and slapped him, saying, 'Don't you rob ? You who rob the
            whole monarchy and the whole country and think nothing of it ? He only takes a little too much ghee for my
            meals and you don't like it.' The Vazir repented, showed his contrition and the King, exercising his
            clemency, gave him a khilat. The Vazir never interfered with the chef again and the latter continued to take
            thirty seers of ghee as before.
